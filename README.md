Nodea
========================
Nodea is a geometric style sans-serif typeface with some subtle humanist influences, created by Ikaheishi in 2017 as part of an experimental foray into typeface design. The name is a portmanteau of “no idea”, and is pronounced [no̞diʌ] (roughly NO-DEE-UH) by its creator.

**Please note that Nodea is currently in developmental state and is *NOT* suitable for use yet.**
